Python package `dsm` provides an API to train the Deep Survival Machines
and associated models for problems in survival analysis. The underlying model
is implemented in `pytorch`.

What is Survival Analysis?
------------------------

**Survival Analysis** involves estimating when an event of interest, \( T \)
would take places given some features or covariates \( X \). In statistics
and ML these scenarious are modelled as regression to estimate the conditional
survival distribution, \( \mathbb{P}(T>t|X) \). As compared to typical
regression problems, Survival Analysis differs in two major ways:

* The Event distribution, \( T \) has positive support ie.
  \( T \in [0, \infty) \).
* There is presence of censoring ie. a large number of instances of data are
  lost to follow up.

   This is the caption of the figure (a simple paragraph).

**Deep Survival Machines (DSM)** is a fully parametric approach to model
Time-to-Event outcomes in the presence of Censoring first introduced in
[\[1\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01176).
In the context of Healthcare ML and Biostatistics, this is known as 'Survival
Analysis'. The key idea behind Deep Survival Machines is to model the
underlying event outcome distribution as a mixure of some fixed \( k \)
parametric distributions. The parameters of these mixture distributions as
well as the mixing weights are modelled using Neural Networks.

Example Usage
-------------

>>> from dsm import DeepSurvivalMachines
>>> from dsm import datasets
>>> # load the SUPPORT dataset.
>>> x, t, e = datasets.load_dataset('SUPPORT')
>>> # instantiate a DeepSurvivalMachines model.
>>> model = DeepSurvivalMachines()
>>> # fit the model to the dataset.
>>> model.fit(x, t, e)
>>> # estimate the predicted risks at the time
>>> model.predict_risk(x, 10)


Deep Recurrent Survival Machines
--------------------------------

**Deep Recurrent Survival Machines (DRSM)** builds on the original **DSM**
model and allows for learning of representations of the input covariates using
**Recurrent Neural Networks** like **LSTMs, GRUs**. Deep Recurrent Survival
Machines is a natural fit to model problems where there are time dependendent
covariates. Examples include situations where we are working with streaming
data like vital signs, degradation monitoring signals in predictive
maintainance. **DRSM** allows the learnt representations at each time step to
involve historical context from previous time steps. **DRSM** implementation in
`dsm` is carried out through an easy to use API,
`DeepRecurrentSurvivalMachines` that accepts lists of data streams and
corresponding failure times. The module automatically takes care of appropriate
batching and padding of variable length sequences.


Deep Convolutional Survival Machines
------------------------------------

Predictive maintenance and medical imaging sometimes requires to work with
image streams. Deep Convolutional Survival Machines extends **DSM** and
**DRSM** to learn representations of the input image data using
convolutional layers. If working with streaming data, the learnt
representations are then passed through an LSTM to model temporal dependencies
before determining the underlying survival distributions.

..warning:: Not Implemented Yet!


Deep Cox Mixtures
------------------

`dsm` includes pytorch implementation of the Deep Cox Mixture model proposed in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06536">Deep Cox Mixtures
for Survival Regression. Machine Learning in Health Conference (2021)</a>

The Deep Cox Mixture involves the assumption that the survival function
of the individual to be a mixture of \( K \)  Cox Models. Conditioned on each
subgroup \( Z=k \) ; the PH assumptions are assumed to hold and the baseline
hazard rates is determined non-parametrically using an spline-interpolated
Breslow's estimator.
