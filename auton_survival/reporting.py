    ----------

      a pandas dataframe containing the survival outcomes. The index of the

    groups: pandas.Series
      a pandas series containing the groups to stratify the Kaplan-Meier
      estimates by.
    plot_counts: bool
      if True, plot the number of at risk and censored individuals in each group.
