This submodule incorporates contributed survival analysis methods.


Deep Cox Mixtures
------------------

The Cox Mixture involves the assumption that the survival function
of the individual to be a mixture of K Cox Models. Conditioned on each
subgroup Z=k; the PH assumptions are assumed to hold and the baseline
hazard rates is determined non-parametrically using an spline-interpolated
Breslow's estimator.

For full details on Deep Cox Mixture, refer to the paper [1].
