Package: `dsm`
-------------

Python package `dsm` provides an API to train the Deep Survival Machines
and associated models for problems in survival analysis. The underlying model
is implemented in `pytorch`.

What is Survival Analysis?
------------------------

**Survival Analysis** involves estimating when an event of interest, _*T*_
would take place given some features or covariates _*X*_. In statistics
and ML, these scenarios are modelled as regression to estimate the conditional
survival distribution, _*P*_(_T_>t|_X_).   
As compared to typical regression problems, Survival Analysis differs in two major ways:

* The Event distribution, _*T*_ has positive support i.e. _*T*_ ∈ [0, ∞).
* There is presence of censoring i.e. a large number of instances of data are
  lost to follow up.

Deep Survival Machines

**Deep Survival Machines (DSM)** is a **fully parametric** approach to model
Time-to-Event outcomes in the presence of Censoring, first introduced in
[\[1\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01176).
In the context of Healthcare ML and Biostatistics, this is known as 'Survival
Analysis'. The key idea behind Deep Survival Machines is to model the
underlying event outcome distribution as a mixure of some fixed \( K \)
parametric distributions. The parameters of these mixture distributions as
well as the mixing weights are modelled using Neural Networks.


Installation
------------

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/autonlab/DeepSurvivalMachines.git

#### Usage Example
    >>> from dsm import DeepSurvivalMachines
    >>> model = DeepSurvivalMachines()
    >>> model.fit()
    >>> model.predict_risk()

Recurrent Deep Survival Machines
--------------------------------

**Recurrent Deep Survival Machines (RDSM)** builds on the original **DSM**
model and allows for learning of representations of the input covariates using
**Recurrent Neural Networks** like **LSTMs, GRUs**. Deep Recurrent Survival
Machines is a natural fit to model problems where there are time dependendent
covariates.

Deep Convolutional Survival Machines
------------------------------------

Predictive maintenance and medical imaging sometimes requires to work with
image streams. Deep Convolutional Survival Machines extends **DSM** and
**DRSM** to learn representations of the input image data using
convolutional layers. If working with streaming data, the learnt
representations are then passed through an LSTM to model temporal dependencies
before determining the underlying survival distributions.
